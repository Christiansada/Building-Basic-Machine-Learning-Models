# Basic-Machine-Learning-Models
This repository contains the code for some of the basic machine learning algorithms that I have worked on. Below are the details of the models implemented:

### Linear Regression
I have built Linear Regression models on two datasets:

- USA housing dataset
- Boston dataset
These models can be used to predict the prices of houses in the respective regions.

### Logistic Regression
I have built a Logistic Regression model on the famous Titanic dataset. This model can be used to predict whether a passenger on the Titanic survived or not.

### K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
I have also built a KNN model using dummy data. This model can be used to classify data points based on their proximity to other data points in the dataset.

Feel free to use these models for your own projects or as a reference for learning the basics of machine learning.
